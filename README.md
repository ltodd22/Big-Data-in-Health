# Big-Data-in-Health

This was a group project where I took the co-lead.
The purpose was to propose an innovative product or service with a quantifiable impact on improving the health outcomes of society.

Our proposed solution was digital group therapy, due to:
-Incredible prevalence of mental health issues in the population
-Rapidly growing trend of mental health issues, due to factors such as Covid-19 and social media
-Current solutions are either very expensive (e.g. individual therapy), not ideal (e.g. antidepressants), or low-quality and hard to access (e.g. low-income group therapy)

By collecting key data upon inception, it's possible to iteratively improve the mental health outcomes. For example, should virtual group therapy consist of individuals that are as heterogeneous as possible? Would having people from different paths of life improve group discussion and outcomes? Even more critically, how can we measure success and improve?

These are all challenging questions and ones that we addressed in our group presentation, that received the top course grade. 

In regards to my contributions:
-Proposed the idea to begin with
-Developed the idea further, such as thinking through which data would be critical and how we could analyze it
-Co-created the PowerPoint and presented it in class
